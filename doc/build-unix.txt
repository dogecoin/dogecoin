UNIX BUILD NOTES
================

To Build
--------

cd src/
make -f makefile.unix            # Headless dogecoind

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Dogecoin-Qt,
the graphical user interface.

Build Instructions Ubuntu (13.04 Raring)
----------------------------------------

    sudo apt-get install build-essential \
                         libssl-dev \
                         libdb5.1++-dev \
                         libboost-all-dev \
                         libqrencode-dev \
                         libminiupnpc-dev

    cd src/
    make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=1 USE_IPV6=1 USE_QRCODE=1

Unless you're debugging, strip debug symbols

    strip dogecoind

Options
-------

miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is compiled in and
turned off by default.  Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:
 USE_UPNP=-    No UPnP support - miniupnp not required
 USE_UPNP=0    (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime
 USE_UPNP=1    UPnP support turned on by default at runtime

libqrencode may be used for QRCode image generation. It can be downloaded
from http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en, or installed via
your package manager. Set USE_QRCODE to control this:
 USE_QRCODE=0   (the default) No QRCode support - libqrcode not required
 USE_QRCODE=1   QRCode support enabled

IPv6 support may be enabled by setting
 USE_IPV6=1    Enable IPv6 support

Security
--------
To help make your dogecoin installation more secure by making certain attacks
impossible to exploit even if a vulnerability is found, you can take the
following measures:

* Position Independent Executable
    Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout
    Randomization offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause
    execution of code at an arbitrary memory location is thwarted if he doesn't
    know where anything useful is located. The stack and heap are randomly
    located by default but this allows the code section to be randomly located
    as well.

    On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this
    will cause an error such as: "relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can
    not be used when making a shared object;"

    To build with PIE, use:
    make -f makefile.unix ... -e PIE=1

    To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of
    paxutils, and use:
    scanelf -e ./dogecoind

    The output should contain:
     TYPE
    ET_DYN

* Non-executable Stack
    If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow
    exploits are possible if vulnerable buffers are found. By default,
    dogecoind should be built with a non-executable stack but if one of the
    libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake
    and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will
    silently build an executable without the non-executable stack protection.

    To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use:
    scanelf -e ./dogecoind

    the output should contain:
    STK/REL/PTL
    RW- R-- RW-

    The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not
    executable.
