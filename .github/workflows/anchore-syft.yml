# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow checks out code, builds an image, performs a container image
# scan with Anchore's Syft tool, and uploads the results to the GitHub Dependency
# submission API.

# For more information on the Anchore sbom-action usage
# and parameters, see https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action. For more
# information about the Anchore SBOM tool, Syft, see
